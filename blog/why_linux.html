            <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
        <p>Did you know Linux powers 90% of the world's supercomputers and most of the internet's servers? But have you ever thought about using it as your daily driver?</p>
        <p>Welcome to this blog, In this blog I will discussing about Linux and why its better to daily drive a Linux.</p>
            <p>Linux is a Operating System (or more like Kernel) based on Unix-like operating systems created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It is an open source operating system and has very huge use cases in the field of technology. 
        <p>A kernel is nothing but a set of rules which instructs the computer hardware to follow given set of protocols and helps in interacting with the software and acts as a bridge between the hardware and the software.</p>
The Linux Kernel is made on C programming language and some of the parts are being converted to Rust language for better functioning of the system.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Why is it a better option to daily drive Linux?</h2>
        <p>Linux is a very lightweight operating system which only takes around 1.5 GB to 2.5 GB of RAM consumption on a 16 GB RAM CPU which is very much ideal for older laptops and PCs. Linux runs on any hardware like x86, ARMs and much more. Whereas. Windows takes 5 GB to 6 GB on average.</p>

        <p>Linux is faster than Windows by lightyears in any given situation and Windows simply cannot match with the speed of Linux.</p>

        <p>Since Linux is a kernel, its source code is used to create many distributions of Linux (shortly called Distro). Every single distro serves for a general purpose as well as for specific purposes.</p>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1. Mint Linux: This is a Linux mainly recommended for beginners and is a very stable operating system.</li>
          <li>2. Ubuntu: A stable Linux distro for beginners which also serves as distro used to host internet servers.,/li>
          <li>3. Fedora: A Linux distro which is also used user-friendly and gets all the recent updates and applications and is constantly updated with newer technologies.</li>
          <li>4. Arch Linux: A DIY Linux distro from intermediate to advance users, which is good for people who want their workflows built by themselves.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Likewise, there are more than hundreds of Linux operating systems to choose from.</p>

        <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
        <p>Since, the Linux kernel is Open Source, it's source code is available to everyone to audit and improve. Vulnerabilities if discovered, are quickly fixed by the community.</p>
        <p>Unlike proprietary systems like Windows Operating Systems where there is way less transparency, there are no hidden backdoors that would compromise user privacy.</p>
        <p>Becasue of Linux's relatively low market share when compared to Windows and MacOS, there are way way waaayyy less malwares and viruses made for Linux.</p>
        
        <h3>Cost Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Most of the best and popular Linux distros are completely free unlike Windows which requires us to pay Rs. 12000 ($139) to buy the OS.</p>
        <p>There are many kinds of Updates in Linux, like Desktop Environment update, Distro update and Kernel level updates which are completely free of cost to get them updated.</p>

        <h3>Customizability</h3>
          <p>Linux is highly customizable and is relatively easy when compared to customising other non-linux Operating Systems.
        <p>There are many distros and there are many Desktop Environments (shortly known as DE) like Gnome, KDE, Sway, XFCE. We can choose whatever DEs we want on our system depending on our requirements.
        <p> There are many tiling window managers like Hyprland, i3, AwesomeWM, DWM and BSPWM. Window Managers are nothing but automatic window tiling instead of manually.</p>
        <div class="container">
        <div align="left">
            <img src="2025-01-16-075754_hyprshot.png" alt="Hyprland" width="800" height="500">
        </div>
        <div align="right">
            <img src="all.png" alt="KDE" width="800" height="500">
        </div>
    </div>
        <p>The above two are my Linux configurations. The one on the left is Hyprland, a WM (Window Manager) and the one on the right is KDE Plasma a DE (Desktop Envornment).</p>

        <p>Likewise, we can customise them accordig to out personal needs and also make them visually pleasing.</p>

        <h3>Software Availability</h3>
        <p>One of the common conceptions of Linux is that it lacks software, but in reality its quite the opposite.
